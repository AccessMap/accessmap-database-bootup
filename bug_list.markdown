#### 0.Preprocessing ####
* ST_merge problem
Return empty collections 

#### 1. Clean_T_gaps ####
* Some of the T_intersection are not discoverd because of the angle tolerance
* Some T intersections are too close.
	Solution: Might merge intersections that are too close.

#### 2. range_cleanning ####
* Same problem as step1 when trying to classify into different range groups
  Solution: may be improved using streets




#### 4. connect_crossing ####
* crossing that are not go cross the street(pendicular)
